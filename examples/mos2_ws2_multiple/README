Here we combine multiple wannierizations into one large structure.
The workflow is as follows:
- generate wad files from previous examples (stack and lateral)
- modify the wads to suit our purpose (here rotate bonds)
- generate Hamiltonian matrices from Layer_Matrix.dat

The Layer_Matrix.dat holds the structure for which we generate Hamiltonians.
It must be generated manually (here an example is provided).
The atomic types must include an index as to which wad file they belong to.
This index must correspond to the order in which the wads are given in the
input script. The format is 'i:type'.

i.e.
The type '1:Mo' is a Molydenum atom found in the second wad file
The type '0:S-026' is a Sulfur atom found in the first wad file
The type '2:W' is a Tungesten atom found in the third wad file

for this example the corresponding line in the 'winput' file is:
wbh = wads/interf_rot.wad wads/dbl_left_rot.wad wads/dbl_right_rot.wad

The output of ltool will specify how the wads are adapted:
e.g. '0 <- 1' means the second wad was adapted to fit the first.

For the example here, the second and third wads get their Fermi levels
and Wannier signs adapted to match the first wad.
Therefore, the valid Fermi energy for the whole structure is that used
for the first wad. That is the Fermi level found in the OUTCAR file
of the lateral example.

The line
wbh_out = interf_mod.wad dbl_left_mod.wad dbl_right_mod.wad
specifies the filenames for the modified wads used when generating
the Hamiltonian matrices.

This feature of combining Wannierizations is experimental. However, it could be
used for quantum transport, except a 'ph_mat_par' file has to be generated first
from the layer matrix and the wads.
