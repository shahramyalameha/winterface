Examples can be run with the 'make' command.
Feel free to edit the input scripts as you see fit.
Matlab scripts to plot the results are included.

mos2:
Generate Hamiltonian matrices for transport in x and y direction.
This is using exact upscaling.

ws2:
Generate Hamiltonian matrices for transport in x and y direction.
This is using exact upscaling.

mos2_ws2_stack:
Generate Hamiltonian matrices for a structure with an overlap region
This is using exact upscaling with some parts missing.

ws2_mos2_lateral:
Generate Hamiltonian matrices with each side extended.
Compute local bandstructures.
This is using inexact upscaling.

mos2_ws2_multiple:
Generate Hamiltonian matrices for a structure made from
multiple Wannierizations. This is experimental and
is using inexact upscaling.

misc:
A demonstration of other switches possible in ltool
-b: compute bandstructures
-bl: bandstructure legacy mode (directly from H_* for OMEN)
-hx: custom Hamiltonian constructor demonstration
-w: generate wannier bonds hamiltonians
-l: manipulate lattices
-p: find primitive unit cell from super cell

note: bl requires to run 'xdir' in mos2 first
